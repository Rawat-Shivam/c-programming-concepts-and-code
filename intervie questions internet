Q4) What is the output?

main()
{
printf("%x",-1<<4);
}

Q5) What is the difference between array of pointers and pointer to an array ? Explain with example.

Q6) What is the output ?

if(c) {
int abc;
abc = a+b*c;
}
printf("c=%d, abc=%d",c,abc);
}

{
int i=5;

i = i++ +i ++i;

printf("%d",i);

}

Q8) Declare a function pointer and explain with an example using it.

Q9) What is the output?

Q14)Logical section question on a simple tricky diagram

Q15)Two numbers add to 110. One number is 150% than the other. What are the two numbers?

Q4) How will you proceed if the kernel source code that you downloaded does not support your board? What are the steps you will take?

Q5) Write all the directories in linux that will be visible to you on your system and the directories of your kernel source code that you have downloaded. Differentiate between both. (Here he asked me whether I am sure of my answers that I wrote wherein I was too confused )

Q6) What is procfs ? What is the importance of procfs? Why it has got that name?

Q7) What is sysfs ?

Q8) What does /dev contain?

Q9) How do you create node for a block device?

Q10)How do you automatically get major number without using udev ? (He asked bcoz I answered udev will automatically update. He wants me to answer by not using udev functions)

Q11)Can the same number be used for creating nodes for both char and block devices?

Q12)Draw the block diagram for a char device driver implementation? (I explained about char device driver by writing all steps. He then asked me further questions )

Q14)What happens if you pass major number as 0 in register_chrdev_region()?

Q15)Can you make your low-level driver directly interact with application without using core layer ? Is core layer mandatory? ( He asked me this question because I drew the block diagram for keyboard low-level driver with core layer and HLD)
