What is structure packing?
Some times it is mandatory to avoid padded bytes among the members of structure. For example, reading contents of ELF file header or BMP or JPEG file header. We need to define a structure similar to that of the header layout and map it. However, care should be exercised in accessing such members. Typically reading byte by byte is an option to avoid misaligned exceptions. There will be hit on performance.

Most of the compilers provide non standard extensions to switch off the default padding like pragmas or command line switches. Consult the documentation of respective compiler for more details.
