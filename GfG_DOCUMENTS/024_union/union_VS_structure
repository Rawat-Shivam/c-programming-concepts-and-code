Similarities between Structure and Union

Both are user-defined data types used to store data of different types as a single unit.
Their members can be objects of any type, including other structures and unions or arrays. A member can also consist of a bit field.
Both structures and unions support only assignment = and sizeof operators. The two structures or unions in the assignment must have the same members and member types.
A structure or a union can be passed by value to functions and returned by value by functions. The argument must have the same type as the function parameter. A structure or union is passed by value just like a scalar variable as a corresponding parameter.
‘.’ operator is used for accessing members.


differences
1)keyword:: struct  || union

2)size:: greater or eqaul to sum of structure members || largest member in union

3)compiler::  when a variable is associated with structure, compiler considers all memebers and allocates memory for each member || when a variable is associated with union, compiler allocates memory by considering size of the largest element 

4)altering value:: one member value has no effect on other member value || alteriing value of any member will have values altered for all members in union

5)accessing 
4)initializing
