Results of comparison operations in C and C++
In C, data type of result of comparison operations is int.

#include<stdio.h> 
int main() 
{ 
    int x = 10, y = 10; 
    printf("%d \n", sizeof(x == y)); 
    printf("%d \n", sizeof(x < y)); 
    return 0; 
}
Output:
4
4

Whereas in C++, type of results of comparison operations is bool
#include<iostream> 
using namespace std; 
int main() 
{ 
    int x = 10, y = 10; 
    cout << sizeof(x == y) << endl; 
    cout << sizeof(x < y); 
    return 0; 
} 
Output:
1
