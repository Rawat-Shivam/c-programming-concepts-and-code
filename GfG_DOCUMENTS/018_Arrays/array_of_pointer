“Array of pointers” is an array of the pointer variables. It is also known as pointer arrays.
Syntax:

int *var_name[array_size];
Declaration of an array of pointers:

 int *ptr[3];
We can make separate pointer variables which can point to the different values or we can make one integer array of pointers that can point to all the values.

We can likewise make an array of pointers to the character to store a list of strings.
#include <stdio.h> 
const int size = 4; 
void main() 
{ 
    // array of pointers to a character 
    // to store a list of strings 
    char* names[] = { 
        "amit", 
        "amar", 
        "ankit", 
        "akhil"
    }; 
    int i = 0; 
    for (i = 0; i < size; i++) { 
        printf("%s\n", names[i]); 
    } 
} 
Output:
amit
amar
ankit
akhil
