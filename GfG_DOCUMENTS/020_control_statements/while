In most computer programming languages, a while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given boolean condition. The boolean condition is either true or false

A simple usage of while(1) can be in the Client-Server program. In the program, the server runs in an infinite while loop to receive the packets sent from the clients.
But practically, it is not advisable to use while(1) in real-world because it increases the CPU usage and also blocks the code i.e one cannot come out from the while(1) until the program is closed manually. while(1) can be used at a place where condition needs to be true always.
