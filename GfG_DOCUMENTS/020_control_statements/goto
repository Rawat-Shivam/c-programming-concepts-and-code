goto statement in C/C++
The goto statement is a jump statement which is sometimes also referred to as unconditional jump statement. The goto statement can be used to jump from anywhere to _____*********anywhere within a function****____.

Syntax:
Syntax1      |   Syntax2
----------------------------
goto label;  |    label:  
.            |    .
.            |    .
.            |    .
label:       |    goto label;

In this case, we will see a situation similar to as shown in Syntax1 above. Suppose we need to write a program which prints numbers from 1 to 10 using the goto statement. Below program explains how to do this.
// C program to print numbers 
// from 1 to 10 using goto statement 
#include <stdio.h> 
  
// function to print numbers from 1 to 10 
void printNumbers() 
{ 
    int n = 1; 
label: 
    printf("%d ",n); 
    n++; 
    if (n <= 10) 
        goto label; 
} 
  
// Driver program to test above function 
int main() { 
    printNumbers(); 
    return 0; 
} 
Output:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Disadvantages of using goto statement:

The use of goto statement is highly discouraged as it makes the program logic very complex.
use of goto makes the task of analyzing and verifying the correctness of programs (particularly those involving loops) very difficult.
Use of goto can be simply avoided using break and continue statements.
