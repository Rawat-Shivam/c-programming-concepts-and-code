Important Points:

Use for loop when number of iterations is known beforehand, i.e. the number of times the loop body is needed to be executed is known.

Use while loops where exact number of iterations is not known but the loop termination condition is known.

Use do while loop if the code needs to be executed at least once like in Menu driven programs
