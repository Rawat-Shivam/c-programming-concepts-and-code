tmpfile() function in C
In C Programming Language, the tmpfile() function is used to produce/create a temporary file.

tmpfile() function is defined in the “stdio.h” header file.
The created temporary file will automatically be deleted after the termination of program.
It opens file in binary update mode i.e., wb+ mode.
The syntax of tmpfile() function is:
FILE *tmpfile(void) 
The tmpfile() function always returns a pointer after the creation of file to the temporary file. If by chance temporary file can not be created, then the tmpfile() function returns NULL pointer.




// C program to demonstrate working of tmpfile() 
#include <stdio.h> 
int main() 
{ 
    char str[] = "Hello GeeksforGeeks"; 
    int i = 0; 
  
    FILE* tmp = tmpfile(); 
    if (tmp == NULL) 
    { 
        puts("Unable to create temp file"); 
        return 0; 
    } 
  
    puts("Temporary file is created\n"); 
    while (str[i] != '\0') 
    { 
        fputc(str[i], tmp); 
        i++; 
    } 
  
    // rewind() function sets the file pointer 
    // at the beginning of the stream. 
    rewind(tmp); 
  
    while (!feof(tmp)) 
        putchar(fgetc(tmp)); 
} 
Output:
Temporary file is created
Hello GeeksforGeeks
