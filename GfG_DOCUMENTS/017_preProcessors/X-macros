X-Macros in C
X-Macros are based on the property of nested macros and the ability to define macros inside other macros. X-Macros are very powerful pre-processor technique in the sense that it can create a self-maintaining and inter-dependent piece of code. When the change of one part of a program leads to a change in another part, then the code is said to be inter-dependent.

Syntax:
An X macro application consists of two parts:

The definition of the listâ€™s elements:
#define VARIABLES \
    X(value1, 1)  \
    .
    .
    .  \
    X(valueN, N)
Expansion(s) of the list to generate fragments of declarations or statements:
#define X(name) int name;
    VARIABLES
#undef X

Advantages of X-Macros
X-Macros are extensively used in Operating System development by creating separate header files for maintainability as well as readability
Helps to maintain complex programming easily
it can create a self-maintaining and inter-dependent piece of code
Disadvantages of X-Macros

The code becomes less readable
Code is complex to understand
Commonly used for internal programming only, like OS programming.
