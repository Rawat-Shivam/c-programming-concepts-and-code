C program to print characters without using format specifiers

As we know that there are various format specifiers in C like %d, %f, %c etc, to help us print characters or other data types. We normally use these specifiers along with the printf() function to print any variables. But there is also a way to print characters specifically without the use of %c format specifier. This can be obtained by using the below-shown method to get the character value of any ASCII codes of any particular character.
Example:



// Prints characters without format specifiers 
#include <stdio.h> 

int main() 
{ 
	printf("\x47 \n"); 
	printf("\x45 \n"); 
	printf("\x45 \n"); 
	printf("\x4b \n"); 
	printf("\x53"); 
	return 0; 
} 

Output:

G 
E 
E 
K 
S
