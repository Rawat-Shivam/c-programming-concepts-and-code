How to find time taken by a command/program on Linux Shell?


We have already discussed a way to find time taken by a function through C libraries. If we are on Linux, then it becomes very easy to find time taken by a program/command.

We can use time command for this purpose. The time taken is shown in three forms.
real: Total end to end time taken by program/command
user: Time taken in user mode.
sys: Time taken in kernel mode


// Running the generated executable with time
~$ time ./a.out
