Interesting facts about data-types and modifiers in C/C++
Here are some logical and interesting facts about data-types and the modifiers associated with data-types:-

1. If no data type is given to a variable, the compiler automatically converts it to int data type.

#include <stdio.h> 
int main() 
{ 
    signed a; 
    signed b; 
  
    // size of a and b is equal to the size of int 
    printf("The size of a is %d\n", sizeof(a));  
    printf("The size of b is %d", sizeof(b));  
    return (0); 
} 
Output:
The size of a is 4
The size of b is 4



2. Signed is the default modifier for char and int data types.
#include <stdio.h> 
int main() 
{ 
    int x; 
    char y; 
    x = -1; 
    y = -2; 
    printf("x is %d and y is %d", x, y); 
} 
Output:
x is -1 and y is -2.

3. We canâ€™t use any modifiers in float data type. If programmer tries to use it ,the compiler automatically gives compile time error.

#include <stdio.h> 
int main() 
{ 
    signed float a; 
    short float b; 
    return (0); 
} 
Output:
[Error] both 'signed' and 'float' in declaration specifiers
[Error] both 'short' and 'float' in declaration specifiers


4. Only long modifier is allowed in double data types. We cant use any other specifier with double data type. If we try any other specifier, compiler will give compile time error.

#include <stdio.h> 
int main() 
{ 
    long double a; 
    return (0); 
} 


#include <stdio.h> 
int main() 
{ 
    short double a; 
    signed double b; 
    return (0); 
} 
Output:
[Error] both 'short' and 'double' in declaration specifiers
[Error] both 'signed' and 'double' in declaration specifiers
